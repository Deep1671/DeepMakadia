      <h2>üë®‚Äçüíª About Me</h2>
      <h6><b>
        Hello! I'm Deep Makadia, a passionate and versatile Computer Science Final year student at Nirma University, driven by curiosity, creativity, and a deep love for technology. With a strong academic foundation and hands-on experience, I specialize in Data Science and Business Strategy, blending technical proficiency with analytical thinking and real-world problem-solving.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Over the past few years, I‚Äôve worked on a diverse range of projects‚Äîfrom building machine learning models for malware classification to analyzing e-commerce sales trends and job market salary data. These experiences have equipped me with skills in Python, Pandas, Seaborn and statistical libraries like SciPy, allowing me to transform complex datasets into compelling, actionable insights.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Beyond coding, I have a keen interest in the business side of technology. I‚Äôve pursued a minor in Marketing, and led the BrainBoost AI project‚Äîan intelligent learning platform for kids‚Äîwhere I applied principles of consumer behavior, product-market fit, and service design. I'm also actively involved in leadership roles, currently serving as the Treasurer of the ACM Student Chapter at my university. In this role, I manage financial operations, oversee budgeting, and coordinate sponsorship and event planning efforts.
<br></br>
<br></br>
My approach to every project is guided by three values: clarity, impact, and continuous improvement. I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy simplifying complexity, and I am always looking to grow‚Äîboth technically and personally.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Whether it's building interactive web apps, creating analytical dashboards, or planning high-impact events, I believe in using technology as a force to educate, empower, and elevate.
