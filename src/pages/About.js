  <p>
        I am a Computer Science student specializing in Data Analytics, with a strong focus on extracting actionable insights from real-world data rather than producing superficial reports. My core skill set lies in Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data manipulation and exploratory analysis, and Power BI for building interactive, insight-driven dashboards that support decision-making.
        During my internship at Innobyte Technologies, I worked hands-on with business datasets, where I was responsible for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data to identify trends, inefficiencies, and performance gaps. I designed interactive Power BI dashboards that translated complex data into clear visual narratives, enabling stakeholders to monitor KPIs, compare performance across dimensions, and make data-backed decisions without needing technical expertise. My work emphasized clarity, performance optimization, and relevance—every visualization served a purpose.
        I approach data analysis as a structured problem-solving process. I start by understanding the business objective, convert it into measurable questions, perform exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and anomalies, and then communicate insights through concise visualizations and explanations. I am comfortable handling messy datasets, dealing with missing values and outliers, and writing clean, reproducible analysis code.
        Beyond my internship experience, I have completed multiple analytics projects involving sales analysis, job salary trends, and large-scale EDA, where I applied statistical reasoning and visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights. These projects strengthened my ability to work independently, validate assumptions with data, and present findings in a way that drives action rather than just observation.
        I am actively seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst where I can contribute analytical thinking, technical expertise, and a results-oriented mindset. I am particularly interested in roles that value depth of analysis, clarity of communication, and real business impact over vanity metrics and decorative dashboards.
